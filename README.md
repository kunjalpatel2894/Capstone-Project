# Capstone-Project

Overview of the Project

This project shows the design and development of smart green environment of garbage monitoring system by measuring the garbage level in real time. The system consisted the ultrasonic sensors which measure the garbage level, an LPC1768 which controls system operation and send the data to Blynk application which represent the amount of trash in the bin. This work demonstrates a system that allows the waste management to monitor based on the level of the garbage depth inside the dustbin. This process indicates the bins that require attention and use can optimize the garbage collection route and ultimately reduce the fuel consumption. It allows management as well as trash collector to set their pickup schedule accordingly.
